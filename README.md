> The PlayerAuctions Manager (PAM) is a software that helps you to manage all of your PlayerAuctions listings at once without editing each listing individually as you would do normally.

## PlayerAuctions

PlayerAuctions is a digital marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of various types of gaming genre, so they can buy and sell digital assets. These include tradable in-game currency, (gold, coins, and cash shop currency), items, skins, accounts, power leveling and boosting services, and CD keys for games and applications. The site is a neutral marketplace that supports player-to-player trading for popular online games such as RuneScape, World of Warcraft, CSGO, PUBG, Path of Exile, League of Legends, Fortnite, Overwatch, Clash of Clans, Apex, Fallout 76 and over 250 other games.

## Purpose of this Project

PlayerAuctions only offers a very restricted seller dashboard which is not particullary user-friendly and also lacks multiple key features such as editing multiple listings at once (e.g. to adjust your prices or the delivery time in which you promise to deliver the item to a customer). Having to work with such an impracticable system, especially if you have listed more than just a few items, and doing multiple changes to your listings a day is a major waste of time and also extremely painful. At a certain point you will spend more time clicking through your listings than actually selling the items and interacting with your customers. I have reached said point a long time ago and for me it just is not feasible anymore to invest that much time just to update my listings. This is why I made the decision to learn Python, to start this project and to share it with every other suffering PlayerAuctions seller.
